We’re working professionals who caught the travel bug long before our first child arrived. Now we love to explore the world as a family. Adventure didn't stop for us when life got busy or when we started a family.  
<br>
We believe that you don’t have to put your dream travel on hold because of a 9-to-5 job or kids. Our journeys are filled with adventure, discovery, and unforgettable moments. With OOTO (Out of the Office) blog we aim to help you plan your next adventure.  
<br>
Whether it’s a weekend getaway or a big expedition, we hope our stories encourage you to seek adventure, embrace new experiences, and show your family the world.
